# 🦁 ARSafariX  
### Explore Animals in Augmented Reality

---

## 📌 What is ARSafariX?

**ARSafariX** is a small AR–based educational application developed as part of the **Multimedia Systems** course at **Bina Nusantara University (BINUS) @Malang**.  
This project introduces young learners to animals through a simple and interactive AR experience.

Children/others can scan animal cards (digital cards, not physical) using their smartphone/other devices, and the animal models will appear in Augmented Reality along with basic explanations displayed inside the app.
